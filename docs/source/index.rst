Welcome to WaveformUncertainty's documentation!
===================================

Package version:
|version|

**WaveformUncertainty** is a Python library that gives the infrastructure necessary for sampling over waveform uncertainty during parameter estimation runs. This infrastructure includes: easy generation of waveform model differences, the parameterization of waveform model differences for efficient storage, a model for waveform uncertainty priors, a waveform model that includes waveform uncertainties, and a spline-based method for efficiently sampling over waveform uncertainty.  

This package relies on bilby and is essentially an addon to bilby. For more information, check out `Bilby's Documentation <https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/bilby/index.html>`_. This work is in collaboration with and derived from past work by Dr. Jocelyn Read. See `Jocelyn Read 2023 Class. Quantum Grav. 40 135002 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06630v2>`_.
